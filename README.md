# js-promise-implementation

implementation of promises in js

## Motivation

You can use the tool much better if you know how it works. Because of this, I decided to write a custom implementation of promise. Promise is the most frequently used feature in javascript (i think so)

## Testing
Also, part of tests are being run with [native](./src/factory/index.js#L130) promise implementation. See [here](./package.json#L19)

## Get started
To install deps:
```shell
yarn install 
```

Run tests:
```shell
yarn test 
```
