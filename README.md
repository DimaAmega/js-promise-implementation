# js-promise-implementation

Custom js promise implementation

## Motivation

You can use the tool much better if you know how it works. Because of this, I decided to write a custom implementation of promise. Promise is the most frequently used feature in javascript (i think so)

## Get started
To install deps:
```shell
yarn install 
```

Run tests:
```shell
yarn test 
```
